# What I'm working on today:
- IDE Navigation: This will improve my familiarity with how the different files impact one another.
- Network Code: Import OkHTTP functions that expressly handle GET, POST, etc. network requests.
- Android Developer Fundamentals: I have a takehome to accomplish, I will slow down and work on my foundational skills.

# Things I've learned:
- I've not been using the IDE enough to know how to find things. I will click around to learn.
- Android's highest level apps are User Apps and System Apps. System Apps allow a developer to get their program to interact with the user directly (i.e. deliver an SMS message).
- Android's stack uses a Java API framework and is built on top of Native C/C++ libraries. (What is Android Runtime?) The **Hardware Abstraction Layer** (HAL) exposes hardware capabilities. I think that means a developer can interact with the phone itself (like the equivalent of OpenGL). At the base of the stack is the Linux Kernel.
